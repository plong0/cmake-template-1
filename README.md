# cmake-template-1

Simple demo project to build a hierarchal project structure using CMake.

Includes some utility scripts (bash):

* `run.sh` - cleans, builds, runs the target (option `--leaks` flag to run through valgrind)
* `build.sh` - cleans, builds the target (option `--debug` flag to compile in debug mode)
* `clean.sh` - cleans existing target and build
